Docker Compose Cheat Sheet (Minimal + Usage)

docker compose up
  → Build (if needed) and start all services.

docker compose up -d
  → Start services in detached/background mode.

docker compose up --build
  → Rebuild images before starting containers.

docker compose down
  → Stop and remove containers, networks.

docker compose down -v
  → Stop containers AND remove volumes (fresh DB reset).

docker compose ps
  → List running containers in this compose project.

docker compose logs
  → Show logs of all services.

docker compose logs -f
  → Stream logs live (like tail -f).

docker compose build
  → Build all images defined in docker-compose.yml.

docker compose start
  → Start already-created containers without recreating them.

docker compose stop
  → Stop services without deleting them.

docker compose restart
  → Restart all services.

docker compose exec <service> sh
  → Open an interactive shell inside a running container.
    Example: docker compose exec flask sh

docker compose run <service> <command>
  → Run a one-off command in a new container.
    Example: docker compose run mysql mysql -u root -p

docker compose config
  → Validate and view the final resolved compose config.

Quick Fix Combo (use when things break):
docker compose down -v
docker compose up --build


# 1. Start Minikube
minikube start

# 2. Create Nginx deployment
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx

# 3. Expose Nginx service
kubectl expose deployment nginx --type=NodePort --port=80

# 4. Open Nginx in browser
minikube service nginx

kubectl get pods
kubectl get services

kubectl delete service nginx
kubectl delete deployment nginx
minikube stop
